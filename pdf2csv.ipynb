Ap- proximate date: 650 B.C.E.\\u20131774 C.E. 4. Mosaics\\u2014Composed of painted pebbles, marble, limestone, and bricks. Floors made of painted pebbles decorated Ancient Greek- period inner courts and rooms. Early Christian churches in Crimea and Kyiv were decorated with mosaics made of marble of various colors, limestone, and bricks. These mosaics were crafted from small cube-shaped stones (tesserae) measuring approximately 4\\u20136 cm x 3\\u20135 cm, set in a limestone mortar or cement. Motifs include, but are not limited to, geometric patterns, palmettes, depictions of people, bor- ders with meanders, waves, braids, pairs of animals, and griffins. They show a variety of colors, including black, white, dark blue, and brown. Approximate date: 700 B.C.E.\\u20131774 C.E. 5. Miniature Columns and Small Altars\\u2014Used to decorate shrines, burials, and churches, miniature columns range in size from 10 to 100 cm high and could be rounded, fluted, twisted, or composed of semi- columns. Made primarily of white marble, gray limestone, or shell rock. Small altars are movable architectural structures with rectan- gular or rounded bases, sometimes column-shaped with a shallow round surface, ranging in height from 10 cm to 1 m. These items are found at Ancient Greek, Roman, Byzantine, and Medieval sites. Ap- proximate date: 650 B.C.E.\\u20131774 C.E. 6. Furniture\\u2014Including, but not limited to, tables, tripods, and stool legs often shaped like lion\\u2019s paws, as well as throne or stool backs and armrests decorated with reliefs or sculptures. Typically made of marble and other stones and dating from the Ancient Greek and Roman periods. Approximate date: 650 B.C.E.\\u20131774 C.E. 7. Slabs with Relief Images and Inscriptions\\u2014Made of marble, limestone, and other local stones, these slabs have been produced since the Bronze Age. Locally quarried slabs are often gray, porous, and rough, while slabs carved in Ukraine on imported marble are white and gray. Motifs on Ancient Greek and Roman period slabs include humans, lions, sphinxes, and griffins, with reliefs sometimes combined with paintings. Inscriptions in various scripts, including Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic, are found on slabs of various shapes and sizes. Approximate date: 3000 B.C.E.\\u20131774 C.E. 8. Sarcophagi, Ossuaries, and Gravestones\\u2014Sarcophagi and ossu- aries are usually rectangular constructions made of jointed or carved slabs; their lids are also included, having roof-like shapes in the Roman period. Sizes vary depending on purpose: for cremations or inhumations, they range from half a meter to several meters. Grave- stones are typically decorated with floral ornaments, rosettes, and\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Under USCIT Rule 41, a plaintiff \\u201cmay dismiss an action without a court order by filing . . . a stipulation of dismissal signed by all parties who have appeared.\\u201d USCIT R. 41(a)(1)(A)(ii). The court held a con- ference on September 10, 2024. During that conference, the parties provided an overview of the preceding litigation and confirmed their intention to dismiss this action with prejudice. See Status Confer- ence.9 The court retains jurisdiction to enforce the United States\\u2019s payment obligations under the parties\\u2019 agreement on attorneys\\u2019 fees and costs associated with this case. To be clear, this opinion does not preclude future legal challenges to the Second Comparability Find- ings. Nor does the court suggest any view on the Second Compara- bility Findings. The case\\u2019s dismissal is issued below, and this case is now closed. But the fate of the Maui dolphin is not so easily resolved. Recent estimates indicate that approximately forty-three dolphins remain, and their population has declined at the rate of 3 to 4 percent per year between 2001 and 2021.10 Today\\u2019s disposition, then, is far from bill of health for a species teetering on the brink of extinction. As the court noted in prior litigation involving the similarly critically endangered vaquita, see supra note 6, the loss of a species represents a \\u201closs of biodiversity, unique evolutionary history, and the potential for future evolution.\\u201d NRDC IV, 456 F. Supp. 3d at 1294. It can be noted that the outcome here reflects the efforts of Plain- tiffs, the United States, and New Zealand as they all work within complex domestic and transnational legal frameworks to avert catas- trophe. At stake is nothing less than the survival of the Maui dolphin, which cannot be replaced. CONCLUSION A voluntary dismissal by joint stipulation under Rule 41(a)(1)(A)(ii) is effective \\u201cautomatically.\\u201d Versata Software, Inc. v. Callidus Soft- ware, Inc., 780 F.3d 1134, 1136 (Fed. Cir. 2015). The Order of Volun- tary Dismissal is granted as requested, and is issued below.

Cole to J. Coit, re: Issuance of Comparability Findings for the Government of New Zealand\\u2019s Set-Net and Trawl Fisheries\\u2014Decision Memorandum at 2 (NOAA Jan. 2, 2024), ECF No. 144\\u20132.\",\n          \"71 CUSTOMS BULLETIN AND DECISIONS, VOL. 58, NO. 38, SEPTEMBER 25, 2024 Officer Hiyama, attempted to communicate with Katana multiple times between June 24, 2018 and March 28, 2019, without a re- sponse. Def.\\u2019s Ex. at 190\\u201391. In these communications, Officer Hi- yama asked for updates from Katana, as well as offered a \\u201cpathway to settlement.\\u201d Def.\\u2019s Ex. 190. The government additionally asserts that there was no affirmative misconduct because the right to present was available as a written submission, and \\u201cKatana recognized that it could be a written submission.\\u201d Oral Arg. 42:24. The parties\\u2019 disagreement about the events that transpired during the time period between October 25, 2016 and July 15, 2019 consti- tutes a genuine dispute about a material fact that cannot be resolved at the summary judgment stage, and without discovery. There is no single test for detecting the presence of affirmative misconduct; each case must be decided on its own particular facts and circumstances. See Dis Vintage, LLC v. United States, 40 Int\\u2019l Trade Rep. (BNA) 1089 at 18 (CIT 2018); Lavin v. Marsh, 644 F.2d 1378, 1382\\u201383 n.6 (9th Cir. 1981). The inquiry is necessarily fact-intensive and given the parties\\u2019 disagreement about the facts surrounding Katana\\u2019s third waiver, it is improper to rule on this affirmative defense under summary judg- ment standards. Katana, however, will have the opportunity to assert its affirmative defense at trial, and both parties will have the oppor- tunity to develop a more thorough factual record through discovery. B. Katana\\u2019s claims regarding its level of culpability as a purported victim of identity theft present an issue of material fact. Also at issue before the court is the government\\u2019s cross motion for partial summary judgment seeking $5,742,483.80 in unpaid duties. The government argues that it has presented evidence which \\u201cwould be admissible at trial\\u201d demonstrating the elements necessary for a 19 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1592(d) claim. Pl.\\u2019s Reply at 3\\u20137. According to the govern- ment, Katana \\u201cfailed to submit evidence that would be admissible at trial to rebut these points.\\u201d Id. The government faults Katana for failing to submit an affidavit or declaration made under penalty of perjury, arguing that \\u201cKatana primarily relies on statements it made to CBP, but those statements are hearsay that would not be admis- sible at trial and, thus, do not establish any dispute of material fact.\\u201d Id. at 1. Katana disagrees, arguing that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure were \\u201camended a few years ago [so] you no longer have to put admissible evidence in support of a summary judgment motion.\\u201d Oral Arg. 33:20\\u201333:21. Katana asserts that the \\u201conly requirement\\u201d at the summary judgment stage of a proceeding is a statement \\u201cwhich could be provided to the court at trial in an admissible form.\\u201d Id. at 33:23\\u201333:25.\",\n          \"79 CUSTOMS BULLETIN AND DECISIONS, VOL. 58, NO. 38, SEPTEMBER 25, 2024 On July 1, 2020, Plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction embargoing the importation of certain fish products from New Zea- land into the United States. See Pls.\\u2019 Mot. for a Prelim. Inj., July 1, 2020, ECF No. 11. As part of their motion, Plaintiffs argued that New Zealand\\u2019s new measures still fell short of comparable U.S. standards. See id. at 16. On July 15, 2020, New Zealand instead requested that NOAA perform a comparability assessment for two fisheries\\u2014the West Coast North Island inshore trawl and inshore set net fisheries\\u2014 pursuant to NOAA\\u2019s Imports Regulation. See Letter from N.Z. to U.S. Dep\\u2019t of Com., re: Comparability Finding Request (July 15, 2020), ECF No. 17\\u20132. The United States accordingly moved for a voluntary remand for NOAA to reconsider the denial of Plaintiffs\\u2019 petition and to consider New Zealand\\u2019s request for comparability findings. See U.S. Gov\\u2019t Partial Consent Mot. to Remand Case, July 17, 2020, ECF No. 17. The court granted the motion and remanded the petition for reconsideration with an opportunity for Plaintiffs to supplement their original petition. See Sea Shepherd I, 469 F. Supp. 3d at 1337\\u201338. On August 27, 2020, Plaintiffs submitted a supplemental petition to NOAA. See Pls.\\u2019 Aug. 27, 2020 Suppl. Maui Dolphin Pet. at 5 (Aug. 27, 2020), SUPP0005 (\\u201cSupplemental Petition\\u201d). The Supplemental Pe- tition broadened the requested ban, now including \\u201cthe import of all fish and fish products originating from fisheries in the entirety of the Maui dolphin\\u2019s current and historical range, which includes the entire coastline of the North Island out to the 100m depth contour, that employ either set nets or trawls.\\u201d Plaintiffs argued that these mea- sures were necessary to meet U.S. standards and that, if not imple- mented, an embargo of all such fish and fish products was required by the MMPA. Id. at 3, 12\\u201313, 15. On November 9, 2020, NOAA published its denial of Plaintiffs\\u2019 Supplemental Petition and issued comparability findings for New Zealand\\u2019s two relevant fisheries. See Notification of Rejection of Peti- tion and Issuance of Comparability Findings, 85 Fed. Reg. 71297, 71297 (Dep\\u2019t Com. Nov. 9, 2020), SUPP0001 (\\u201cFirst Comparability Findings\\u201d). It reasoned that New Zealand\\u2019s \\u201cregulatory program, implemented on October 1, 2020, will in all likelihood reduce Maui dolphin bycatch below PBR\\u201d\\u2014which NOAA calculated to allow one death every eight years\\u2014and was otherwise comparable in effective- ness to U.S. standards. See First Comparability Findings, 85 Fed. Reg. at 71298. NOAA also rejected Plaintiffs\\u2019 broad definition of the Maui dolphin\\u2019s habitat and limited it to the \\u201cwest coast of the North Island.\\u201d See Dec. Mem. attach. A at 6. The issued comparability findings would remain in effect through January 1, 2023. See First Comparability Findings, 85 Fed. Reg. at 71297.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
