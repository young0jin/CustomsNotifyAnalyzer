2,"2 CUSTOMS BULLETIN AND DECISIONS, VOL. 58, NO. 38, SEPTEMBER 25, 2024 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The Convention on Cultural Property Implementation Act (Pub. L. 97–446, 19 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.) (CPIA), which implements the 1970 United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property (823 U.N.T.S. 231 (1972)) (Convention), allows for the con- clusion of an agreement between the United States and another party to the Convention to impose import restrictions on eligible archaeo- logical and ethnological material. In certain limited circumstances, the CPIA authorizes the imposition of restrictions on an emergency basis (19 U.S.C. 2603). The emergency restrictions are effective for no more than five years from the date of the State Party’s request and may be extended for three years where it is determined that the emergency condition continues to apply with respect to the covered material (19 U.S.C. 2603(c)(3)). These restrictions may also be con- tinued, in whole or in part, pursuant to an agreement concluded within the meaning of the CPIA (19 U.S.C. 2603(c)(4)). On February 7, 2020, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) published a final rule, CBP Decision (CBP Dec.) 20–01, in the Fed- eral Register (85 FR 7209), which amended § 12.104g(b) of title 19 of the Code of Federal Regulations (19 CFR 12.104g(b)) to reflect the imposition of import restrictions on certain archaeological material and ethnological material of Yemen under the emergency protection provisions of the CPIA. Following imposition of the emergency import restrictions, the United States entered into a bilateral agreement with the Republic of Yemen1 under the CPIA to continue the emergency import restric- tions on certain archaeological and ethnological material of Yemen through April 15, 2029, with modifications to the Designated List. This period may be extended for additional periods, each extension not to exceed 5 years, if it is determined that the factors justifying the initial agreement still pertain and no cause for suspension of the agreement exists (19 U.S.C. 2602(e); § 12.104g(a) of title 19 of the Code of Federal Regulations (19 CFR 12.104g(a))). Determinations Under 19 U.S.C. 2602(a)(1), the United States must make certain determinations before entering into an agreement to impose import 1 Due to an ongoing conflict within Yemen, this rule shall use the ‘‘Republic of Yemen’’ to denote the State party to the agreement and ‘‘Yemen’’ when discussing the archaeological/ ethnological material and cultural heritage subject to the import restrictions."
3,"3 CUSTOMS BULLETIN AND DECISIONS, VOL. 58, NO. 38, SEPTEMBER 25, 2024 restrictions under 19 U.S.C. 2602(a)(2). On November 18, 2022, the Assistant Secretary for Educational and Cultural Affairs, United States Department of State, after consultation with and recommen- dation by the Cultural Property Advisory Committee, made the de- terminations required under the statute with respect to certain ar- chaeological and ethnological material originating in Yemen that is described in the Designated List set forth below in this document. These determinations include the following: (1) that the cultural patrimony of Yemen is in jeopardy from the pillage of archaeological material, dating from approximately 200,000 B.C. to A.D. 1773, and ethnological material representing Yemen’s cultural heritage, rang- ing in date from approximately A.D. 1517 through 1918 (19 U.S.C. 2602(a)(1)(A)); (2) that the Republic of Yemen Government has taken measures consistent with the Convention to protect its cultural pat- rimony (19 U.S.C. 2602(a)(1)(B)); (3) that import restrictions imposed by the United States would be of substantial benefit in deterring a serious situation of pillage and remedies less drastic are not available (19 U.S.C. 2602(a)(1)(C)); and (4) that the application of import re- strictions as set forth in this final rule is consistent with the general interests of the international community in the interchange of cul- tural property among nations for scientific, cultural, and educational purposes (19 U.S.C. 2602(a)(1)(D)). The Assistant Secretary also found that the material included in the determinations meets the statutory definition of ‘‘archaeological or ethnological material of the State Party’’ (19 U.S.C. 2601(2)). The Agreement On August 30, 2023, the Governments of the United States and the Republic of Yemen signed a bilateral agreement, ‘‘Memorandum of Understanding Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of Yemen Concerning the Imposition of Import Restrictions on Categories of Archaeological and Ethnological Material of Yemen,’’ (the Agreement) pursuant to the provisions of 19 U.S.C. 2602(a)(2). The Agreement entered into force on April 15, 2024, following the exchange of diplomatic notes, and modifies the previously imposed emergency import restrictions on archaeological material dated from approximately 200,000 B.C. to A.D. 1773, as well as certain ethnological material of Yemeni cultural heritage from A.D. 1517 through 1918. A list of the categories of archaeological and ethnological material subject to the import restric- tions is set forth later in this document."
4,"4 CUSTOMS BULLETIN AND DECISIONS, VOL. 58, NO. 38, SEPTEMBER 25, 2024 Restrictions and Amendment to the Regulations Import restrictions on the archaeological and ethnological material of Yemen previously reflected in § 12.104g(b) will be continued through the Agreement without interruption. Accordingly, § 12.104g(a) of the CBP regulations is being amended to indicate that restrictions have been imposed pursuant to the Agreement, and the emergency import restrictions on certain categories of archaeological and ethnological material of Yemen are being removed from § 12.104g(b), as those restrictions are now encompassed in § 12.104g(a). Pursuant to the Agreement, and consistent with the CPIA, the Designated List originally published with the emergency restrictions in CBP Dec. 20–01 is being amended to correct certain typographical errors, to extend the date range for archaeological material to A.D. 1773, to clarify certain categories of archaeological material, to add the subcategory ‘‘Inscribed Documents’’ to the list of archaeological materials, to clarify that the ethnological material listed excludes Jewish ceremonial and ritual objects and manu- scripts, and to reorganize the list of ethnological material by type of object instead of by material. Designated List of Archaeological and Ethnological Material of Yemen The Agreement between the United States and the Republic of Yemen includes, but is not limited to, the categories of objects de- scribed in the Designated List set forth below. The Designated List includes archaeological and ethnological ma- terial from Yemen. The archaeological material in the Designated List includes, but is not limited to, objects made of stone, metal, ceramic, clay, glass, faience, semi-precious stone, paintings, plaster, textiles, leather, parchment, paper, wood, bone, ivory, shell, human remains, and/or other organic materials dated from approximately 200,000 B.C. to A.D. 1773. The ethnological material in the Desig- nated List includes, but is not limited to, architectural materials, manuscripts, and religious and ceremonial objects from approxi- mately A.D. 1517 to 1918. This would exclude Jewish ceremonial or ritual objects and manuscripts. The Designated List is representative only. Any dates and dimensions are approximate. For the reader’s convenience, CBP is reproducing the Designated List contained in CBP Dec. 20–01 in its entirety with the previously detailed modifi- cations."

Inapplicability of Notice and Delayed Effective Date This amendment involves a foreign affairs function of the United States and is, therefore, being made without notice or public proce- dure under 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1). For the same reason, a delayed effec- tive date is not required under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3). Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 Executive Orders 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review), as amended by Executive Order 14094 (Modernizing Regulatory Re- view), and 13563 (Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review) direct agencies to assess the costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory ap- proaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). Executive Order 13563 emphasizes the importance of quantifying costs and benefits, reducing costs, harmonizing rules,"
17,"17 CUSTOMS BULLETIN AND DECISIONS, VOL. 58, NO. 38, SEPTEMBER 25, 2024 and promoting flexibility. CBP has determined that this document is not a regulation or rule subject to the provisions of Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 because it pertains to a foreign affairs function of the United States, as described above, and therefore is specifically exempted by section 3(d)(2) of Executive Order 12866 and, by exten- sion, Executive Order 13563. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), as amended by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, requires an agency to prepare and make available to the public a regulatory flexibility analysis that describes the effect of a proposed rule on small entities (i.e., small businesses, small organizations, and small governmental jurisdictions) when the agency is required to publish a general notice of proposed rulemaking for a rule. Since a general notice of proposed rulemaking is not necessary for this rule, CBP is not required to prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis for this rule. Signing Authority This regulation is being issued in accordance with 19 CFR 0.1(a)(1) pertaining to the Secretary of the Treasury’s authority (or that of the Secretary’s delegate) to approve regulations related to customs rev- enue functions.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The Convention on Cultural Property Implementation Act (Pub. L. 97–446, 19 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.) (CPIA), which implements the 1970 United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property (823 U.N.T.S. 231 (1972)) (Convention), allows for the con-"
20,"20 CUSTOMS BULLETIN AND DECISIONS, VOL. 58, NO. 38, SEPTEMBER 25, 2024 clusion of an agreement between the United States and another party to the Convention to impose import restrictions on eligible archaeo- logical and ethnological material. In certain limited circumstances, the CPIA authorizes the imposition of restrictions on an emergency basis (19 U.S.C. 2603). The emergency restrictions are effective for no more than five years from the date of the State Party’s request and may be extended for three years where it is determined that the emergency condition continues to apply with respect to the covered material (19 U.S.C. 2603(c)(3)). These restrictions may also be con- tinued, in whole or in part, pursuant to an agreement concluded within the meaning of the CPIA (19 U.S.C. 2603(c)(4)). Determinations Pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 2602(a), the government of Ukraine, a State Party to the Convention, requested on March 5, 2024, that import restrictions be imposed on certain archaeological and ethnological material, the pillage of which jeopardizes the cultural heritage of Ukraine. The CPIA authorizes the President (or designee) to apply import restrictions on an emergency basis if the President determines that an emergency condition applies with respect to any archaeologi- cal or ethnological material of any requesting State Party (19 U.S.C. 2603). On July 26, 2024, the Assistant Secretary for Educational and Cultural Affairs, United States Department of State, after consulta- tion with and recommendation by the Cultural Property Advisory Committee, made the determinations necessary under the CPIA for the emergency imposition of import restrictions on categories of ar- chaeological material and ethnological material of the cultural heri- tage of Ukraine. The Designated List below sets forth the categories of material to which the import restrictions apply. Thus, U.S. Cus- toms and Border Protection (CBP) is amending § 12.104g(b) of title 19 of the Code of Federal Regulations (19 CFR 12.104g(b)) accordingly. Importation of covered material from Ukraine will be restricted until March 5, 2029, unless the conditions set forth in 19 U.S.C. 2606 and 19 CFR 12.104c are met.

Inapplicability of Notice and Delayed Effective Date This regulation involves a foreign affairs function of the United States and is, therefore, being made without notice or public proce- dure under 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1). For the same reason, a delayed effec- tive date is not required under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3). Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 Executive Orders 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review), as amended by Executive Order 14094 (Modernizing Regulatory Re- view), and 13563 (Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review) direct agencies to assess the costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory ap- proaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). Executive Order 13563 emphasizes the importance of quantifying costs and benefits, reducing costs, harmonizing rules, and promoting flexibility. CBP has determined that this document is not a regulation or rule subject to the provisions of Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 because it pertains to a foreign affairs function of the United States, as described above, and therefore is specifically exempted by section 3(d)(2) of Executive Order 12866 and, by exten- sion, Executive Order 13563.

Since a general notice of proposed rulemaking is not necessary for this rule, CBP is not required to prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis for this rule.

ACTION: Notice of revocation of five ruling letters and revocation of treatment relating to the tariff classification of electromechanical oral hygiene devices. SUMMARY: Pursuant to section 625(c), Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. § 1625(c)), as amended by section 623 of title VI (Customs Modern- ization) of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementa- tion Act (Pub. L. 103–182, 107 Stat. 2057), this notice advises inter- ested parties that U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is revoking five ruling letters concerning tariff classification of electro- mechanical oral hygiene devices under the Harmonized Tariff Sched- ule of the United States (HTSUS). Similarly, CBP is revoking any treatment previously accorded by CBP to substantially identical transactions. Notice of the proposed action was published in the Customs Bulletin, Vol. 58, No. 30, on July 31, 2024. No comments were received in response to that notice. EFFECTIVE DATE: This action is effective for merchandise entered or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption on or after November 25, 2024. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Suzanne Kingsbury, Electronics, Machinery, Automotive and International Nomenclature Branch, Regulations and Rulings, Office of Trade, at suzanne.kingsbury@cbp.dhs.gov. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: BACKGROUND Current customs law includes two key concepts: informed compli- ance and shared responsibility. Accordingly, the law imposes an obli- gation on CBP to provide the public with information concerning the trade community’s responsibilities and rights under the customs and related laws. In addition, both the public and CBP share responsibil- ity in carrying out import requirements. For example, under section 484 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. § 1484), the importer of record is responsible for using reasonable care to enter,"
44,"44 CUSTOMS BULLETIN AND DECISIONS, VOL. 58, NO. 38, SEPTEMBER 25, 2024 classify and value imported merchandise, and to provide any other information necessary to enable CBP to properly assess duties, collect accurate statistics, and determine whether any other applicable legal requirement is met. Pursuant to 19 U.S.C. § 1625(c)(1), a notice was published in the Customs Bulletin, Vol. 58, No. 30, on July 31, 2024, proposing to revoke five ruling letters pertaining to the classification of electrome- chanical oral hygiene devices. Any party who has received an inter- pretive ruling or decision (i.e., a ruling letter, internal advice memo- randum or decision, or protest review decision) on the merchandise subject to this notice should have advised CBP during the comment period. Similarly, pursuant to 19 U.S.C. § 1625(c)(2), CBP is revoking any treatment previously accorded by CBP to substantially identical transactions. Any person involved in substantially identical transac- tions should have advised CBP during the comment period. An im- porter’s failure to advise CBP of substantially identical transactions or of a specific ruling not identified in this notice may raise issues of reasonable care on the part of the importer or its agents for impor- tations of merchandise subsequent to the effective date of this notice. In New York Ruling Letter (NY) N282485, NY H80038, NY N219961, NY N219968 and NY N317507, CBP classified electrome- chanical oral hygiene devices in heading 8424, HTSUS, which pro- vides for “[M]echanical appliances (whether or not hand operated) for projecting, dispersing or spraying liquids or powders; fire extinguish- ers, whether or not charged; spray guns and similar appliances; steam or sand blasting machines and similar jet projecting machines; parts thereof.” CBP has reviewed these rulings and determined them to be in error. It is now CBP’s position that electromechanical oral hygiene devices are properly classified in heading 8509, HTSUS, specifically in subheading 8509.80.50, HTSUS, which provides for “[E]lectro-mechanical domestic appliances, with self-contained elec- tric motor, other than vacuum cleaners of heading 85.08; parts thereof: Other appliances: Other.” Pursuant to 19 U.S.C. § 1625(c)(1), CBP is revoking NY N282485, NY H80038, NY N219961, NY N219968 and NY N317507 and is revoking or modifying any other ruling not specifically identified to reflect the analysis contained in the proposed Headquarters Ruling Letter (HQ) H331605, set forth as an attachment to this notice. Additionally, pursuant to 19 U.S.C. § 1625(c)(2), CBP is revoking any treatment previously accorded by CBP to substantially identical transactions."

TROTTA: This ruling is in reference to New York Ruling Letter (NY) N282485, issued to you on February 8, 2017, on behalf of Conair Corporation, in which U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) classified two models of oral hygiene devices (personal oral irrigation devices) under heading 8424, specifically subheading 8424.89.90, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), which provides for “[M]echanical appliances (whether or not hand operated) for projecting, dispersing or spraying liquids or powders; fire ex- tinguishers, whether or not charged; spray guns and similar appliances; steam or sand blasting machines and similar jet projecting machines; parts thereof: Other appliances: Other.” Upon review, we have determined that NY N282485 is in error. CBP has also undertaken review of NY H80038 (May 10, 2001), NY N219961 (Jun. 28, 2012), NY N219968 (Jun. 28, 2012), and NY N317507 (Mar. 3, 2021), in which CBP classified substantially similar oral hygiene devices as mechanical appliances for spraying liquids under heading 8424, HTSUS. As with NY N282485, CBP has determined that the tariff classifi- cation of the articles at issue in NY H80038, NY N219961, NY N219968, and NY N317507 is incorrect. Pursuant to section 625(c)(1), Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1625(c)(1)), as amended by section 623 of Title VI, a notice proposing to revoke NY N282485, NY H80038, NY N219961, NY N219968, and NY N317507 was published on July 31, 2024, in Volume 58, Number 30 of the Customs Bulletin. No com- ments were received in response to the proposed action. FACTS: NY N282485 classified two models of oral irrigation devices, identified as the Interplak Compact Dental Water Jet (Item WJ3CSR) and the Interplak All-in-One Sonic Water Jet System (Item SWJ1B). Both devices are designed to remove plaque and food from a user’s teeth by means of a stream of pulsating water. The Compact Dental Water Jet is a battery-operated, por- table oral irrigation device that features two color coded jet tips, 3-foot coil hose, and 300ml water reservoir. The All-In-One Sonic Water Jet System is an oral irrigation device that features an 800ml water tank, 7-setting pres- sure control, water jet tip, and five attachments that include toothbrush heads, gum massager, and tongue cleaner. In NY H80038, CBP classified a battery-operated “family oral irrigator” (Teledyne Water Pik WP-70W), consisting of a plastic reservoir for fluids, 4"
47,"47 CUSTOMS BULLETIN AND DECISIONS, VOL. 58, NO. 38, SEPTEMBER 25, 2024 color-coded jet tips, and electric pump, under subheading 8424.89.70, HTSUS (2001). In NY N219961, CBP classified a retail set consisting of a water flosser and a rechargeable electric toothbrush with charger (Water Pik WP- 900) under subheading 8424.89.00, HTSUS (2012). In NY N219968, CBP classified a retail set consisting of a water flosser and a non-rechargeable electric toothbrush (Water Pik WP-700) under subheading 8424.89.00, HT- SUS (2012). In NY N317507, CBP classified a rechargeable handheld oral water flosser that attaches to a shower head under subheading 8424.89.90, HTSUS (2021). LAW AND ANALYSIS: Classification under the HTSUS is in accordance with the General Rules of Interpretation (GRIs). GRI 1 provides that the classification of goods will be determined according to the terms of the headings of the tariff schedule and any relative section or chapter notes. If goods cannot be classified solely on the basis of GRI 1, and if the headings and legal notes do not otherwise require, the remaining GRIs 2 through 6 will then be applied in order. The following HTS headings are under consideration: 8424 Mechanical appliances (whether or not hand operated) for project- ing, dispersing or spraying liquids or powders; fire extinguishers, whether or not charged; spray guns and similar appliances; steam or sand blasting machines and similar jet projecting machines; parts thereof: 8509 Electromechanical domestic appliances, with self-contained electric motor, other than vacuum cleaners of heading 8508; parts thereof: Chapter 84, Note 1(f), excludes, in pertinent part, “Electromechanical do- mestic appliances of heading 8509....” Note 4 to Chapter 85 provides, in pertinent part: Heading 8509 covers only the following electromechanical machines of the kind commonly used for domestic purposes: (a) Floor polishers, food grinders and mixers, and fruit or vegetable juice extractors, of any weight; (b) Other machines provided the weight of such machines does not exceed 20 kg, exclusive of extra interchangeable parts or detachable auxiliary devices.... The Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System Explanatory Notes (ENs) constitute the official interpretation of the Harmonized System at the international level. While neither legally binding nor dispositive, the ENs provide a commentary on the scope of each heading of the HTSUS and are generally indicative of the proper interpretation of these headings. See T.D. 89–80, 54 Fed. Reg. 35127, 35128 (Aug. 23, 1989). The Explanatory Note (EN) to 85.09 states, “[T]his heading covers a num- ber of domestic appliances in which an electric motor is incorporated. The term ‘domestic appliances’ in this heading means appliances normally used in the household.” The devices described in NYs N282485, NY H80038, NY N317507, N219961 and N219968 are electromechanical appliances with self-contained electric motors commonly used in the home for oral hygiene. They weigh less than the 20 kg threshold provided in Note 4(b) to Chapter 85. Thus, the"
48,"48 CUSTOMS BULLETIN AND DECISIONS, VOL. 58, NO. 38, SEPTEMBER 25, 2024 subject articles are described by heading 8509, specifically subheading 8509.80.50, HTSUS, which provides for other electromechanical domestic appliances, with self-contained electric motor and are therefore precluded from classification in heading 8424, HTSUS, by Chapter 84 Note 1(f). This classification is consistent with NY 852646 (May 25, 1990) in which CBP classified a personal battery-operated portable oral water flosser in subhead- ing 8509.80.00, HTSUS (1990). HOLDING: By application of GRIs 1 and 6, the subject oral hygiene devices at issue in NY N282485, NY H80038, NY N219961, NY N219968, and NY N317507 are classified under heading 8509, specifically subheading 8509.80.50, HTSUS, which provides for “[E]lectro-mechanical domestic appliances, with self- contained electric motor, other than vacuum cleaners of heading 85.08; parts thereof: Other appliances: Other.” The applicable rate of duty is 4.2% ad valorem. Duty rates are provided for your convenience and are subject to change. The text of the most recent HTSUS and the accompanying duty rates are provided on the internet at www.usitc.gov. EFFECT ON OTHER RULINGS: NY N282485, dated February 8, 2017, NY H80038, dated May 10, 2001, NY N219961, dated June 28, 2012, NY N219968 dated June 28, 2012, and NY N317507, dated March 3, 2021, are hereby REVOKED.

55,"U.S. Court of International Trade ◆ Slip Op. 24–100 UNITED STATES, Plaintiff, v. KATANA RACING, INC. d/b/a WHEEL & TIRE DISTRIBUTORS, Defendant. Before: Lisa W. Wang, Judge Court No. 19–00125 [Defendant’s motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim is denied. Defendant’s motion for summary judgment in the alternative is denied. Plaintiffs motion for partial summary judgment is denied.] Dated: September 9, 2024 Emma Eaton Bond, Trial Attorney, Commercial Litigation Branch, Civil Division, U.S. Department of Justice, of Washington, DC, argued for the plaintiff. John M. Peterson, Neville Peterson, LLP, of New York, NY, argued for defendant Katana Racing, Inc. With him on the brief were Patrick Brady Klein and Richard F. O’Neill. OPINION AND ORDER Wang, Judge: The government (“Plaintiff” or “government”) seeks unpaid duties “stem[ming] from violations of 19 U.S.C. § 1592(a), with respect to 386 entries of certain passenger vehicle and light truck tires (‘PVLT’) from [the People’s Republic of] China into the United States from November 24, 2009 through August 7, 2012” via “false statements” on entry forms filed with Plaintiffs U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“Customs”). Campl. ¶¶ 1, 13. The Defendant, Katana Racing, Inc. (“Defendant” or “Katana”) moves to dismiss Plaintiff’s complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant to United States Court of International Trade (“CIT”) Rule 12(b)(6), or in the alternative, to grant summary judgment pursuant to CIT Rule 56. Def.’s Renewed Mot. to Dismiss for Failure to State a Claim, Or in the Alternative, for Summ. J., Nov. 14, 2023, ECF No. 40 (“Def.’s Mot.”). Plaintiff opposes the motion and, in its cross motion, moves for partial summary judgment. Pl.’s Cross Mot. for Partial Summ. J. and Opp. To Def.’s Combined Mot. to Dismiss and Mot. for Summ. J., ECF No. 46 (“Pl.’s Resp.”). With respect to Defendant’s motion to dismiss, the issues before the court are whether the government’s complaint: (1) fails to properly identify the person liable for a violation of 19 U.S.C. § 1592(a), and the level of culpability attributable to such person; (2) fails to allege 57"
56,"58 CUSTOMS BULLETIN AND DECISIONS, VOL. 58, NO. 38, SEPTEMBER 25, 2024 exhaustion of available administrative remedies; (3) alleged claims barred by laches; and (4) alleges claims barred by the statute of limitations due to the government’s purported affirmative misconduct in obtaining a statute of limitations waiver. In the alternative, Ka- tana seeks a motion for summary judgment. Additionally, the court must determine whether Katana’s motion in for summary judgement in the alternative or the government’s partial motion for summary judgment are proper and justiciable at this stage of proceedings. For reasons discussed herein, Defendant’s motion to dismiss is denied; Defendant’s motion for summary judgment in the alternative is denied; and Plaintiff’s motion for partial summary judgment is denied. BACKGROUND I. Case History Prior to This Suit On July 15, 2019, the United States brought an action before the CIT against Katana Racing, Inc. to recover unpaid customs duties and fees pursuant to the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, 19 U.S.C. § 1592(d), based on violations of 19 U.S.C. § 1592(a). Compl. ¶ 1. The government alleges that Katana, a California-based distributor of wheels and tires, was the importer of record for 386 entries of PVLT from China between November 24, 2009, and August 7, 2012. Id. ¶ 3. Throughout that time, Customs alleges that Katana undercalculated the amount of safeguard duties, regular customs duties, harbor main- tenance fees, and merchandise processing fees it owed Customs by $5,742,483.80. Id. ¶ 13. After Customs conducted an audit and iden- tified the unpaid duties amount, the parties remained in communi- cation and Katana agreed to three waivers of the statute of limita- tions, the first of which was signed on May 15, 2014. Def.’s Mot. to Dismiss, ECF No. 12–3, Attached Exhibits. (“Def.’s Ex.”) at 159–62. The third and final waiver, dated October 25, 2016, indicated that the statute of limitations would be waived “up to and including July 15, 2019.” Compl. ¶ 4. II. Case History at Initial United States Court of International Trade Appearance The government filed suit for the unpaid duties on July 15, 2019. Compl. ¶ 1. On August 30, 2019, Katana moved to dismiss the action under CIT Rule 12(b)(6) for “failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted” and under CIT Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of jurisdiction. United States v. Katana Racing, Inc. (“Katana I”), 569 F. Supp. 3d 1296, 1298 (CIT 2022). Katana asserted that “it had been the victim"
57,"59 CUSTOMS BULLETIN AND DECISIONS, VOL. 58, NO. 38, SEPTEMBER 25, 2024 of a pervasive scheme of . . . ‘identity theft’, as PRC vendors had engaged U.S. customs brokers to file entries in Katana’s name, with- out its knowledge or permission.” Id. at 1302. Katana’s three main arguments were: (1) the government’s com- plaint should be dismissed under CIT Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim because Customs never found a violation of 19 U.S.C. § 1592(a), which is a prerequisite to penalties under 19 U.S.C. § 1592(c) and assertion of unpaid duties under 19 U.S.C. § 1592(d); (2) the government’s complaint should be dismissed under CIT Rule 12(b)(6) because Customs was required to exhaust administrative remedies set forth in 19 U.S.C. § 1592(b) prior to determining a violation of 19 U.S.C. § 1592(a); and (3) that the government’s suit was untimely and should be dismissed under CIT Rule 12(b)(1) because Katana had revoked its final waiver of the statute of limitations due to Customs’ failure to undertake administrative proceedings to determine the validity of Katana’s identity theft claim. Id. at 1302–1308. In its response, the government argued that: (1) Customs did not have to establish a violation of 19 U.S.C. § 1592(a) prior to bringing suit to recover duties under [§] 1592(d), and need only allege a vio- lation of § 1592(a) in its complaint; (2) Customs did not have to exhaust administrative remedies because 19 U.S.C. § 1592(d) creates an independent cause of action for unpaid duties without exhaustion of administrative remedies; and (3) the suit was timely because Ka- tana did not properly revoke its third waiver of the statute of limita- tions, as the government did not promise administrative proceedings in exchange for the waiver and Customs justifiably relied on that waiver. Id. The court granted Katana’s motion to dismiss on March 28, 2022. The court held that the suit was “barred by the passage of time” because the June 26, 2019 revocation of the third waiver of the statute of limitations was effective after Customs failed to meet its “promise” of providing administrative procedures. Id. at 1314. The court further held that the government could not bring suit against Katana solely as the importer of record, and instead was required to provide “precise reasons for holding a defendant ‘responsible’ for paying its § 1592(d) duty demand in its complaint.” Id. III. Case History at Appeal The government appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (“Federal Circuit”) on May 25, 2022, and con- tended “that the Court of International Trade erroneously dismissed its suit for lack of jurisdiction pursuant to CIT Rule 12(b)(1).” United"
58,"60 CUSTOMS BULLETIN AND DECISIONS, VOL. 58, NO. 38, SEPTEMBER 25, 2024 States v. Katana Racing, Inc. (“Katana II”), 75 F.4th 1346, 1351 (Fed. Cir. 2023). In its appeal, the government contended: (1) that “the statute of limitations set forth at 19 U.S.C. § 1621 is not jurisdic- tional. Rather, it is an affirmative defense that, at the pleading stage, must be adjudicated based on the well-pleaded facts in the com- plaint”; (2) that “the government may bring a non-penalty action for duties under [§] 1592(d) without first undertaking the administrative procedures necessary to find that Katana, itself, violated [§] 1592(a)”; and (3) that “the court erred by holding that Katana’s status as importer of record was not sufficient to state a claim under [§] 1592(d).” Id. Katana, in response, argued that the “the statute of limitations waiver was procured by deception, specifically, Customs’ false prom- ise of the administrative proceedings required by § 1592(b), and that therefore it was in fact ‘void,’ as opposed to ‘revoked.’” Id. Following oral argument, Katana “agreed with the government that, to the extent the Court of International Trade dismissed the government’s suit for lack of jurisdiction, it erred.” Id. “Instead, Katana argued that the Court of International Trade issued an appealable decision on Katana’s USCIT Rule 12(b)(6) because it lacks factual allegations supporting Katana’s culpability under § 1592(a).” Id. at 1352. The Federal Circuit held, “that the Court of International Trade erred in dismissing the government’s suit for lack of jurisdiction under CIT Rule 12(b)(1).” Id. at 1353. In its analysis, the Federal Circuit explained that the statute of limitations set forth in 19 U.S.C. § 1621 is not a jurisdictional time limit but is an affirmative defense, and that “a statute of limitations waiver, which is tantamount to a ‘consensual extension of the limitations period,’ serves to preclude the defendant from raising the statute of limitations as an affirmative defense.” Id. (citing United States v. Inn Foods, Inc., 383 F.3d 1319, 1322 (Fed. Cir. 2004)). Ultimately, the Federal Circuit held that, “because the Court of International Trade erred in dismissing for lack of jurisdiction, we reverse the court’s decision and remand the case to the court for further proceedings.” Id. The Federal Circuit provided that on remand, Katana can “assert any and all defenses to the government’s claim for unpaid duties,” but that Katana cannot argue that “Customs was required by statute to follow the penalty assessment procedures set forth in 19 U.S.C. § 1592(b) ... [as] such procedure[s] were not statutorily required.” Id. at 1353–1354. The Federal Circuit further declined to address the suf- ficiency of the complaint on appeal, and provided that, “on remand, Katana may renew its motion to dismiss under CIT Rule 12(b)(6) or seek summary judgment.” Id. at 1353, n.5. The Federal Circuit also"
59,"61 CUSTOMS BULLETIN AND DECISIONS, VOL. 58, NO. 38, SEPTEMBER 25, 2024 provided that, on remand, “Katana will be able to assert as an affir- mative defense its claim that its third statute of limitations waiver was void.” Id. at 1353 (emphasis added). IV. Case on Remand Upon remand, Katana renews its CIT Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dis- miss, asserting that the complaint should be dismissed because the third statute of limitations waiver is void due to the purported affir- mative misconduct of the government. Katana argues that “[i]ndeed, the Court of Appeals stated ‘[i]nstead, on remand Katana may renew its motion to dismiss under CIT Rule 12(b)(6) or seek summary judgment.’” Def.’s Mot. at 6 n.3. Katana asserts that the complaint should be dismissed under CIT Rule 12(b)(6) because the government failed to state a claim by (1) failing to properly identify the person liable for the violation, and (2) failing to identify the proper level of culpability under 19 U.S.C. § 1592(a). Def.’s Mot. at 12. Katana asserts that the complaint should be dismissed under CIT Rule 12(b)(6) because the government failed to exhaust administrative remedies as required by 28 U.S.C. § 2637(d). Def.’s Mot. at 6. Finally, Katana asserts that the complaint should be dismissed under CIT Rule 12(b)(6) because it is barred by laches. Def.’s Mot. at 27. Katana moves for summary judgment in the alternative. Def.’s Mot. at 29. The government, in its response and later reply, argues that: (1) the government did not engage in affirmative misconduct in procuring a statute of limitations waiver from Katana; (2) its complaint was properly pleaded; (3) it was not required to exhaust administrative remedies; and (4) its suit is not barred by laches. Pl.’s Resp. The government moves for partial summary judgment, arguing that as the importer of record, Katana is liable for unpaid duties, and that there is no dispute of material, admissible facts. Pl.’s Resp. and Pl.’s Reply in Supp. of Cross Mot. for Partial Summ. J., ECF No. 50 (“Pl.’s Reply”). STANDARD OF REVIEW Whether the court has subject matter jurisdiction to hear an action is a “threshold” inquiry. Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env’t, 523 U.S. 83, 94–95 (1998). In considering a motion to dismiss under CIT Rule 12(b)(6), the court must accept well-pleaded factual allegations to be true and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmo- vant. Wanxiang Am. Corp. v. United States, 12 F.4th 1369, 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2021). To survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, “a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim of relief that is plausible on its face.’” Ashcroft v. Iqbal"
60,"62 CUSTOMS BULLETIN AND DECISIONS, VOL. 58, NO. 38, SEPTEMBER 25, 2024 (“Iqbal”), 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)). Additionally, a motion for summary judgment will be granted “if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” CIT R. 56(a); Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc. (“Liberty Lobby”), 477 U.S. 242, 247 (1986). DISCUSSION Although nearly fifteen years have passed since the first entry of tires into the United States without payment of required duties for which Katana was the alleged importer of record, the lengthy admin- istrative history and considerable judicial resources which have al- ready been expended in refereeing the controversy between the gov- ernment and Katana do not change the procedural posture of the motions before the court: the parties’ respective motions are each upon the initial pleadings, the Defendant has not filed an answer to the government’s complaint, and the discovery process has not yet begun. The events which underlie the government’s claims and Ka- tana’s defenses are variously described and contested in both their substance and their import. Despite submitting and responding to a CIT Rule 56.3 statement, the parties have not yet established a body of undisputed facts that the court could rely upon in determining that no genuine dispute of any material fact exists. The court has only the parties’ pleadings and their representations made at oral argument upon which to base its determinations as to the propriety and per- suasiveness of the arguments set forth in their motions. That proce- dural posture informs and compels the court’s analysis and decisions below. I. Katana’s 12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss Is Denied A. The government sufficiently alleged the culpability level for an action under 19 U.S.C. § 1592(d). The first issue is whether the government asserted the proper level of culpability in its complaint. To survive a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, a complaint must show the court that the pleader is entitled to relief through well-pleaded facts accepted as true. In United States v. Blum, the Federal Circuit held that independent action can be brought for unpaid duties under 19 U.S.C. § 1592(d) without finding the requisite culpability level under 19 U.S.C. § 1592(a). 858 F.2d 1566, 1570 (Fed. Cir. 1988). “[F]or ordinary negligence [the government] need only"
61,"63 CUSTOMS BULLETIN AND DECISIONS, VOL. 58, NO. 38, SEPTEMBER 25, 2024 show that acts or omissions constituting a violation occurred.” United States v. KAB Trade Co., 21 CIT 297, 303 (1997). States of mind for negligence may be pleaded generally. Id. Iqbal provides that factual assertions are the lynchpin of a claim, and that conclusory legal opinions will not suffice. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 1950. The government brings a 19 U.S.C. § 1592(d) claim against Katana for unpaid duties in the amount of $5,742,483.80, without seeking additional penalties. Compl. ¶ 1. Although the government did not use the term “negligence,” it alleged in its complaint that Katana, “as the importer of record,” engaged in conduct which fell below “the reasonable standard of care” required under 19 U.S.C. § 1592(a). Id. ¶ 14. There are three levels of culpability under 19 U.S.C. § 1592: (1) negligence; (2) gross negligence; and (3) fraud. 19 C.F.R. pt. 171, app. B(C) (2023). “As a general rule, a violation is negligent if it results from failure to exercise reasonable care and competence.” Id. (empha- sis added). In comparison, gross negligence and fraud have height- ened mens rea culpability levels; where grossly negligent violations are done with actual knowledge of or wanton disregard, and fraudu- lent violations are the result of a known material false statement, omission, or act. Id. The court has previously explained that these three culpability levels are distinct from one another, and only one may be pleaded at the complaint stage: It is clear that the three alternative theories of liability recog- nized by 19 U.S.C. § 1592 are mutually exclusive. See 19 U.S.C. § 1592(a)(1) (1999) (indicating that a violation may occur “by fraud, gross negligence or negligence”). Congress’ use of the word “or” indicates that a choice must be made among the three theories; for purposes of determining penalty liability under 19 U.S.C. § 1592, a person who commits a customs violation may not have more than one mens rea at the time of commission. United States v. Pan Pac. Textile Grp., Inc., 395 F. Supp. 2d, 1244, 1258 (CIT 2005). The Supreme Court has further instructed that it is the function of a claim, not the form, that guides a lawsuit by explaining the ele- ments of a claim will guide the suit throughout litigation. Comcast Corp. v. Nat’l Ass’n of Afr. Am.-Owned Media, 589 U.S. 327, 332 (2020). In Comcast Corp., the Court held that while the difficulty to satisfy the elements of a claim may increase, the elements themselves do not change: Normally, too, the essential elements of a claim remain constant through the life of a lawsuit. What a plaintiff must do to satisfy"
62,"64 CUSTOMS BULLETIN AND DECISIONS, VOL. 58, NO. 38, SEPTEMBER 25, 2024 those elements may increase as a case progresses from com- plaint to trial, but the legal elements themselves do not change. So, to determine what the plaintiff must plausibly allege at the outset of a lawsuit, we usually ask what the plaintiff must prove in the trial at its end. 589 U.S. at 332. The government claims that “Katana did not exercise reasonable care to ensure that these entries, for which Katana is the importer of record, reflected accurate values of the merchandise, and thus Ka- tana violated 19 U.S.C. § 1592(a).” Compl. ¶ 14. The government’s factual allegations of the entries, paired with the “scheme” described, do not collectively transmogrify into a constructive allegation of fraud. See id. ¶ 13. Instead, these are factual allegations required in a complaint to support the asserted elements for a claim of negli- gence, the reasonable standard of care. These elements, alleged in the initial complaint, are the elements that will remain constant throughout the suit. See Compl. ¶ 14; Comcast Corp, 589 U.S. at 332. Further, this Court has previously held that a violation of 19 U.S.C. § 1592(a) creates a presumption of negligence, It is basic that the applicable statute generally supersedes other standards of conduct. See 2 American Law Institute, Restate- ment of the Law Second § 284 (1965). Further, violation of the statute [19 U.S.C. § 1592(a)] creates a presumption of negli- gence. See W. Prosser, Handbook of the Law of Torts 200 (1971). It therefore follows that a statute-based claim which adequately pleads elements of the statute satisfies the pleading require- ment [...]. United States v. Valley Steel Prod. Co., 12 CIT 1161, 1162 (1988); United States v. Jac Natori Co., 821 F. Supp. 1514 (CIT 1993). Although it did not use the term “negligence,” the government properly described the culpability level for negligence, which is the exercise of “reasonable care and competence.” 19 C.F.R. pt. 171, app. B(C) (2023). The government’s allegation of violating the elements for negligence under a statute, 19 U.S.C. § 1592(a), paired with sufficient factual allegations of the claimed violation, satisfies a claim for neg- ligence. Katana’s motion to dismiss on the grounds that the govern- ment failed to allege the requisite culpability in its initial complaint is denied."
63,"65 CUSTOMS BULLETIN AND DECISIONS, VOL. 58, NO. 38, SEPTEMBER 25, 2024 B. The government properly identified the person responsible for the violation. The next issue is whether the government properly alleged the person or entity liable for unpaid duties in its complaint. Blum provides that importers of record can be held liable for unpaid duties. 858 F.2d at 1570. The Federal Circuit explained that, Although such parties may be innocent of a subsection (a) vio- lation, these parties, if determined to be liable for import duties, are not “innocent” with respect to subsection (d). Subsection (d) allows the United States to recover duties that would have been paid but-for conduct that violates subsection (a). It follows that subsection (d) provides the United States with a cause of action to recover duties from those parties traditionally liable for such duties, e.g., the importer of record and its surety. Id. Additionally, this Court has held that, [A]s importer of record, [a defendant is] clearly a ‘person’ within the meaning of 19 U.S.C. § 1592(a) and, as such, may be held liable for a violation of that statute. This Court has repeatedly held that an importer of record belongs to the class of “persons” subject to liability under 19 U.S.C. § 1592(a) and against whom a claim may be brought for suspect entries. Pan Pac. Textile Grp., Inc., 395 F. Supp. 2d. at 1250 (citing United States v. F.H. Fenderson, Inc. ,658 F. Supp. 894 (CIT 1987)). Where it is uncontested that a defendant is the importer of record for shipments at issue, he is a “person” subject to 19 U.S.C. § 1592(a) liability. Id.; see also United States v. Pacheco, 151 F. Supp. 3d, 1323, 1327 (CIT 2015) (“Having given Individual A a power of attorney, Pacheco, as principal, can be held liable for her agent Individual A’s actions whether or not she authorized the specific unlawful conduct which constituted the violation of section 1592.”). Further, 19 U.S.C. § 1592(d) requires only that “if the United States has been deprived of lawful duties, taxes, or fees as a result of a violation of subsection (a), the Customs Service shall require that such lawful duties, taxes, and fees be restored, whether or not a monetary penalty is assessed.” 19 U.S.C. § 1592(d). There are suffi- cient factual allegations pleaded to show that the government be- lieves that Katana, as the alleged importer of record, is culpable for violating subsection (a) under a theory of negligence, and therefore, may be found liable for the unpaid duties. See generally Compl."
64,"66 CUSTOMS BULLETIN AND DECISIONS, VOL. 58, NO. 38, SEPTEMBER 25, 2024 Nonetheless, the Federal Circuit has made clear that Katana is “entitled to assert any and all defenses to the government’s claims for unpaid duties,” including its claims that it was the victim of identity theft. Katana II, 75 F.4th at 1354. Such defenses, however, entail fact-based inquiries that are not suited for resolution at the threshold stage of this proceeding. For purposes of its claim, the government properly alleged the “person” within the meaning of a 19 U.S.C. § 1592(a) violation. Katana’s motion to dismiss on the grounds of the government’s failing to name the “person” in its initial complaint is denied. C. The government was not required to exhaust administrative remedies prior to filing suit. The next issue is whether the government was required to exhaust administrative procedures pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2637(d) prior to filing suit for a 19 U.S.C. § 1592(d) claim. In remanding the case, the Federal Circuit held that, Katana will not be able to argue that Customs was required by statute to follow the penalty assessment procedures set forth in 19 U.S.C. § 1592(b). As the government argues and as Katana recognizes, such procedures were not statutorily required. Sec- tion 1592(b) provides the applicable procedures for issuing a pre-penalty and penalty notice in the event the government seeks to collect penalties for a violation of § 1592(a). In contrast, § 1592(d) explains that “the Customs Service shall require that ... lawful duties, taxes, and fees be restored, whether or not a monetary penalty is assessed.” 19 U.S.C. § 1592(d). Thus, when a penalty is not assessed, as here, the statute does not mandate the performance of the procedures under § 1592(b). Katana II, 75 F.4th at 1354 (emphasis in original). The Federal Circuit has held that the government’s claim for un- paid duties under 19 U.S.C. § 1592(d) does not require the perfor- mance or exhaustion of the administrative procedures under 19 U.S.C. § 1592(b). Katana has not alleged what additional adminis- trative procedures might be required beyond those set forth in sub- section (b).1 As such, it would be inappropriate for the court to create further administrative procedure requirements through application 1 Instead, Katana again alleges that “[w]hile [...] Customs is not required to follow the elaborate procedures of § 1592(b) when asserting a claim for withheld duties, it must articulate that there was a culpable violation of § 1592(a).” Def.’s Mot. at 10. As previously discussed, Customs has alleged a culpable violation of 19 U.S.C. § 1592(a)."
65,"67 CUSTOMS BULLETIN AND DECISIONS, VOL. 58, NO. 38, SEPTEMBER 25, 2024 of the catch-all provision of 28 U.S.C. § 2637(d). Katana’s motion to dismiss for failure to exhaust additional administrative remedies is denied. D. This claim is not barred by laches. The next issue in Katana’s renewed motion to dismiss is whether the government’s claim is barred by laches. The Supreme Court has provided guidance for determining timeli- ness of suit when Congress has specifically enacted a statute of limitations. In SCA Hygiene Prod. Aktiebolag v. First Quality Baby Prod., LLC, the Court held that, Laches provides a shield against untimely claims, and statutes of limitations serve a similar function. When Congress enacts a statute of limitations, it speaks directly to the issue of timeliness and provides a rule for determining whether a claim is timely enough to permit relief. The enactment of a statute of limita- tions necessarily reflects a congressional decision that the time- liness of covered claims is better judged on the basis of a gen- erally hard and fast rule rather than the sort of case-specific judicial determination that occurs when a laches defense is asserted. Therefore, applying laches within a limitations period specified by Congress would give judges a “legislation- overriding” role that is beyond the Judiciary’s power. As we stressed in Petrella, “courts are not at liberty to jettison Con- gress’ judgment on the timeliness of suit.” SCA Hygiene Prod. Aktiebolag v. First Quality Baby Prod., LLC, 580 U.S. 328, 334–35 (2017) (internal citations omitted) (quoting Petrella v. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc., 572 U.S. 663, 667 (2014)). At oral argument, Katana was asked to explain why its argument regarding laches is appropriate given the clear directive from the Supreme Court. Oral Arg. 46:4–5, ECF No. 56. Katana failed to explain why this court should depart from the Supreme Court’s hold- ing or how the facts of this proceeding are distinguishable.2 As such, the court will not take on a “legislation-overriding” role. Katana’s motion to dismiss under a theory of laches is denied. 2 In response to questioning as to whether Katana wanted to continue its laches argument despite clear directive from the Supreme Court in SCA Hygiene Prod. Aktiebolag, counsel for Katana replied, “You know, the normal questions of laches apply; dimmed recollection, dimmed access to documents.” Oral Arg. 48:13–16."
66,"68 CUSTOMS BULLETIN AND DECISIONS, VOL. 58, NO. 38, SEPTEMBER 25, 2024 E. Katana’s assertion of affirmative misconduct is appropriately raised by motion for summary judgment. The Federal Circuit held that the court erred in dismissing the case for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction under CIT Rule 12(b)(1), and that on remand Katana has the option to either “renew its motion to dismiss under USCIT Rule 12(b)(6) or seek summary judgment.” Katana II, 75 F.4th at 1353 n.5. The Federal Circuit explained that Katana is “able to assert as an affirmative defense its claim that its third statute of limitations waiver was void.” Katana II, 75 F.4th at 1353. Specifically, a waiver may be found to be void if it is not “voluntary” or is procured from an act of “affirmative misconduct.” Id. (citing United States v. Ford Motor Co., 497 F.3d 1331,1336 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Stange v. United States, 282 U.S. 270, 276 (1931)). Thus, if Katana were able to demonstrate that the execution of its third statute of limitations waiver was procured through the government’s affirmative misconduct, it would be able to raise the statute of limi- tations as an affirmative defense to the government’s claims.3 Generally, an affirmative defense is not properly raised at the mo- tion to dismiss stage, and instead is asserted at trial or at the sum- mary judgment stage by reference to undisputed material facts. See Toxgon Corp. v. BNFL, Inc., 312 F.3d 1379, 1382 (Fed. Cir. 2002); Transamerica Premier Life Ins. Co. v. Selman & Co., LLC, 401 F. Supp. 3d 576, 588 (D. Md. 2019) (“Courts ordinarily do not ‘resolve contests surrounding the facts, the merits of a claim, or the applica- bility of defenses’ through a Rule 12(b)(6) motion.”). An exception exists, and an affirmative defense may be considered at the motion to dismiss stage when it “clearly appears on the face of the pleading.” Mobile Acuity Ltd. v. Blippar Ltd., 110 F.4th 1280, 1289 (Fed. Cir. 2024) (quoting Boquist v. Courtney, 32 F.4th 764, 774 (9th Cir. 2022) (“Ordinarily affirmative defenses may not be raised by motion to dismiss .... But a complaint may be dismissed when the allegations of the complaint give rise to an affirmative defense that clearly appears on the face of the pleading.”)). A motion to dismiss based upon an affirmative defense must be resolved by summary judgment stan- dards if it relies upon matters outside the pleadings. CODA Dev. s.r.o v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 916 F.3d 1350, 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (“If a court does consider material outside the pleadings, the motion to dismiss must be treated as a motion for summary judgment under Rule 56 and all parties must be given a reasonable opportunity to 3 While Katana did not explicitly assert the claimed affirmative misconduct as an affirma- tive defense, the court will treat it as such following the Federal Circuit’s guidance. See Katana II, 75 F.4th at 1353."
67,"69 CUSTOMS BULLETIN AND DECISIONS, VOL. 58, NO. 38, SEPTEMBER 25, 2024 present all material pertinent to the motion.”); see also 5C Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1366 (3d ed. 2018) (“Once the district court decides to accept matters outside of the pleadings, the presence of the word ‘must’ [in Rule 12(d)] indicates that the judge must convert the motion to dismiss into one for summary judgment.”). In its renewed motion to dismiss pursuant to CIT Rule 12(b)(6), Katana asserts that the government engaged in affirmative miscon- duct by inducing Katana to agree to a waiver of the statute of limi- tations in exchange for a promise to make a “presentation.” Def’s. Mot. at 21. Katana provides multiple exhibits in support of this affirmative defense assertion, including written statements between Customs officers and Katana’s lawyers discussing this purported pre- sentation. Def.’s Ex. at 182. In its complaint, however, the govern- ment asserted that, This action is timely pursuant to 19 U.S.C. § 1621. Katana executed a waiver of the statute of limitations for a two-year period commencing on May 15, 2014. On July 15, 2015, Katana signed a second two-year waiver that extended the period of the waiver until July 15, 2017. On October 25, 2016, Katana signed a third waiver for a period “up to and including July 15, 2019.” Compl. ¶ 4. The government’s assertion in its initial complaint is valid on its face. As such, within the context of a motion to dismiss, the court cannot consider Katana’s assertion of affirmative misconduct as an affirmative defense given the factual dispute as to whether its third waiver of the statute of limitations is void. This factual dispute relies on matters outside the initial pleading, rather than on the face of the complaint itself. Therefore, it is appropriate to analyze Katana’s arguments respecting its allegations of the government’s affirmative misconduct under the rubric of a motion for summary judgment. II. Katana’s Motion for Summary Judgment and Government’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment Are Denied Summary judgment is proper when “the movant shows that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” CIT Rule 56(a); see also Celotex Corp. v. Catrett (“Celotex”), 477 U.S. 317, 324 (1986). The Federal Circuit has explained that the “movant bears the burden of demonstrating ab- sence of all genuine issues of material fact” and the court “must view the evidence in a light most favorable to the nonmovant and draw all reasonable inferences in its favor and must resolve all doubt over"
68,"70 CUSTOMS BULLETIN AND DECISIONS, VOL. 58, NO. 38, SEPTEMBER 25, 2024 factual issues in favor of the party opposing summary judgment.” SRI Int’l v. Matsushita Elec. Corp. of America, (citation omitted) 775 F.2d 1107, 1116 (Fed. Cir. 1985). If a genuine dispute about a material fact exists, summary judg- ment must be denied. Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. at 248. A dispute is “genuine” only if a reasonable fact-finder could find for the non- moving party; a fact is “material” only if it is capable of affecting the outcome of the litigation. Id. The primary responsibility of the court on a motion for summary judgment is to determine whether there are any factual issues to be tried. Dan-Dee Imports, Inc. v. United States, 7 CIT 241, 243 (1984); Yamaha International Corp. v. United States, 3 CIT 108, 109 (1982); Outlet Book Co. v. United States, 11 CIT 598, 599 (1987). A. Katana’s claim regarding the government’s purported affirmative misconduct presents an issue of material fact. Because Katana’s affirmative defense alleging the government’s purported affirmative misconduct relies on arguments outside of the initial pleadings, the court now considers those arguments under summary judgment standards. Outside of the initial pleadings, Katana asserts that the govern- ment engaged in affirmative misconduct by inducing Katana to agree to a waiver of the statute of limitations in exchange for a promise to make a “presentation.” Def’s. Mot. at 21. Katana argues that it relied on this opportunity to make a presentation in order to “exonerate itself” prior to the government’s demand for payment of unpaid du- ties. Id. at 23. In support of this argument, Katana cites to a March 21, 2016, meeting where Katana’s President, General Manager and Controller, and counsel met with Customs Deputy Assistant Director Jorge A. Garcia. Def.’s. Mot. 20–21. After this meeting, and reflected in a March 22, 2016, letter, Mr. Garcia granted Katana an extension of time to tender the claimed unpaid duties and allowed Katana the “right to make presentations in response to that demand in accor- dance with 19 U.S.C. § 1618.” Def.’s Ex. at 182. Katana executed its third statute of limitations waiver on October 25, 2016. Def.’s Ex. at 186. Katana asserts that the opportunity to make a presentation was later revoked and that the affirmative misconduct is “the refusal of Customs at Detroit to honor the promise of Mr. Garcia from Los Angeles, that we would be given the opportu- nity to come in and make a presentation about the identity theft.” Oral Arg. 40:19–22. The government disagrees that there was any affirmative miscon- duct. The government presented evidence that a Customs official,"
69,"71 CUSTOMS BULLETIN AND DECISIONS, VOL. 58, NO. 38, SEPTEMBER 25, 2024 Officer Hiyama, attempted to communicate with Katana multiple times between June 24, 2018 and March 28, 2019, without a re- sponse. Def.’s Ex. at 190–91. In these communications, Officer Hi- yama asked for updates from Katana, as well as offered a “pathway to settlement.” Def.’s Ex. 190. The government additionally asserts that there was no affirmative misconduct because the right to present was available as a written submission, and “Katana recognized that it could be a written submission.” Oral Arg. 42:24. The parties’ disagreement about the events that transpired during the time period between October 25, 2016 and July 15, 2019 consti- tutes a genuine dispute about a material fact that cannot be resolved at the summary judgment stage, and without discovery. There is no single test for detecting the presence of affirmative misconduct; each case must be decided on its own particular facts and circumstances. See Dis Vintage, LLC v. United States, 40 Int’l Trade Rep. (BNA) 1089 at 18 (CIT 2018); Lavin v. Marsh, 644 F.2d 1378, 1382–83 n.6 (9th Cir. 1981). The inquiry is necessarily fact-intensive and given the parties’ disagreement about the facts surrounding Katana’s third waiver, it is improper to rule on this affirmative defense under summary judg- ment standards. Katana, however, will have the opportunity to assert its affirmative defense at trial, and both parties will have the oppor- tunity to develop a more thorough factual record through discovery. B. Katana’s claims regarding its level of culpability as a purported victim of identity theft present an issue of material fact. Also at issue before the court is the government’s cross motion for partial summary judgment seeking $5,742,483.80 in unpaid duties. The government argues that it has presented evidence which “would be admissible at trial” demonstrating the elements necessary for a 19 U.S.C. § 1592(d) claim. Pl.’s Reply at 3–7. According to the govern- ment, Katana “failed to submit evidence that would be admissible at trial to rebut these points.” Id. The government faults Katana for failing to submit an affidavit or declaration made under penalty of perjury, arguing that “Katana primarily relies on statements it made to CBP, but those statements are hearsay that would not be admis- sible at trial and, thus, do not establish any dispute of material fact.” Id. at 1. Katana disagrees, arguing that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure were “amended a few years ago [so] you no longer have to put admissible evidence in support of a summary judgment motion.” Oral Arg. 33:20–33:21. Katana asserts that the “only requirement” at the summary judgment stage of a proceeding is a statement “which could be provided to the court at trial in an admissible form.” Id. at 33:23–33:25."
70,"72 CUSTOMS BULLETIN AND DECISIONS, VOL. 58, NO. 38, SEPTEMBER 25, 2024 Katana is correct that when considering a motion for summary judgment, the court may consider evidence presented in a form that would be inadmissible at trial. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324 (“We do not mean that the nonmoving party must produce evidence in a form that would be admissible at trial in order to avoid summary judgment.”). The inquiry for summary judgment purposes is “whether the cited evidence may be reduced to admissible form, not whether it is admis- sible in the form submitted at the summary judgment stage.” United States v. Univar USA Inc. (“Univar USA”), 355 F. Supp. 3d 1225, 1235–1236 (CIT 2018) (quoting United States v. Sterling Footwear, Inc. (“Sterling Footwear”), 279 F. Supp. 3d 1113, 1124 (CIT 2017)); see also United States v. Harvic Int’l, Ltd., 427 F. Supp. 3d 1349, 1356 (CIT 2020). The government relies on the hearsay rule as the basis for its summary judgment argument. Pl.’s Reply at 3–7. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered “to prove the truth of the matter as- serted in the statement.” Fed. R. Evid. 801(c). Hearsay is inadmis- sible at trial unless a federal statute, Federal Rule of Evidence, or other rule “prescribed by the Supreme Court” provides otherwise. Fed. R. Evid. 802. Nonetheless, a court “may consider a hearsay statement in passing on a motion for summary judgment if the state- ment could be reduced to admissible evidence at trial or reduced to admissible form.” Sterling Footwear, 279 F. Supp. 3d at 1124–25 (2017). Cf. CIT Rule 56(c)(2). Here, the email statements made by Katana’s employees regarding its claims of identity theft as a defense against culpability may be hearsay to the extent that they are used to prove the truth of the matter asserted.4 See Fed. R. Evid. 801(c). However, “[t]he most obvious way that hearsay testimony can be reduced to admissible form is to have the hearsay declarant testify directly to the matter at trial.” Sterling Footwear, 279 F. Supp. 3d at 1124–25. Counsel for Katana stated that with respect to these statements, “there’s an author and a recipient of the email; they could be made to testify at trial.” Oral Arg. 34:3–34.5. The government has made no indication that these individuals would not be able to testify at trial. As such, irrespective of the government’s arguments regarding the form of the statements, the content of Katana’s statements indicates that there is a genuine dispute as to one of the most significant material facts of the case: the person or entity who is liable under 19 U.S.C. § 1592(a) for the claim of unpaid duties under 19 U.S.C. § 1592(d). Summary judgment is not appropriate when such a signifi- cant material fact is in dispute, and CIT Rule 56 was not meant or 4 The court makes no finding regarding the admissibility of such statements as hearsay."
71,"73 CUSTOMS BULLETIN AND DECISIONS, VOL. 58, NO. 38, SEPTEMBER 25, 2024 anticipated to be used in such manner. See Univar USA, 355 F. Supp. 3d at 1235–1236. Both Katana’s motion for summary judgment in the alternative and the government’s motion for partial summary judgment are therefore denied. CONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons, Defendant’s motion to dismiss is DE- NIED; Defendant’s motion for summary judgment in the alternative is DENIED; and Plaintiff’s motion for partial summary judgment is DENIED. It is ORDERED that both parties are hereby directed to file with this court within forty-five days of the date of this order an amended Joint Status Report and Proposed Scheduling Order.

OPINION AND ORDER Katzmann, Judge: The court returns to the case of the critically endangered Maui dolphin—one of the world’s smallest dolphins—that is endemic to the waters of New Zealand. See Sea Shepherd N.Z. v. United States (“Sea Shepherd I”), 44 CIT __, 469 F. Supp. 3d 1330 (2020), ECF No. 38; Sea Shepherd N.Z. v. United States (“Sea Shepherd II”), 46 CIT __, 606 F.

United States (“Sea Shepherd V”), 48 CIT __, 693 F. Supp. 3d 1364 (2024), ECF No. 153. Sea Shepherd New Zealand and Sea Shepherd Conservation Society (“Plaintiffs”) initiated this law- suit in 2020 with the fundamental claim that as a result of incidental capture (“bycatch”) in gillnet and trawl fisheries within their range, the Maui dolphin population is declining such that a U.S. ban on importing certain fish and fish products from New Zealand is re- quired by the Marine Mammal Protection Act (“MMPA”). See First Supp. Compl. ¶¶ 1–4, Nov. 24, 2020, ECF No. 46. Defendants the United States and constituent agencies and officials (“United States”) and Defendant-Intervenor New Zealand Government (“New Zea- land”) have long opposed Plaintiffs’ central claim, maintaining that New Zealand’s standards satisfy the MMPA. The stakes of this case are high. With only 43 remaining dolphins by recent estimates,1 the Maui dolphin is on the brink of extinction. As discussed in greater detail below, developments over years of litigation in this case have reflected the parties’ collective view of the urgency of the situation. In November 2022, the court issued a pre- liminary injunction banning the importation of certain fish products from New Zealand. The court lifted that injunction after the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (“NOAA”) found in January 2024 that “effective for the period from February 21, 2024, through December 31, 2025, New Zealand had established that its fisheries’ measures for reducing the bycatch of Maui dolphins satisfy the provisions of the MMPA.” Sea Shepherd V, 693 F. Supp. 3d at 1367. The court did so on the motion of New Zealand, with the consent of the United States, and with no opposition by Plaintiffs. The parties have now filed a joint stipulation of dismissal with prejudice under USCIT Rule 41. See Stipulation and Proposed Order of Voluntary Dismissal (“Notice of Dismissal”), August 23, 2024, ECF No. 162. The case is accordingly dismissed by operation of the parties’ Notice of Dismissal. The court retains jurisdiction to enforce fees and costs. BACKGROUND Recognizing the seriousness of the interests at stake, the court pauses to recount the history of the litigation and outline the current state of affairs. In doing so, the court presumes familiarity with the background of this litigation as outlined in prior opinions. See Sea Shepherd I, 469 F. Supp. 3d 1330; Sea Shepherd II, 606 F. Supp. 3d 1286; Sea Shepherd III, 611 F. Supp. 3d 1406; Sea Shepherd IV, 639 1 See infra note 10 and accompanying text."

The court here summarizes the main developments in this case’s history before discussing the stipulated dismissal before the court. I. Factual Background The court begins with a summary of the relatively few undisputed facts. The critically endangered Maui dolphin is endemic to the wa- ters around New Zealand’s North Island. See First Suppl. Compl. ¶ 51, Nov. 24, 2020, ECF No. 46 (“First Suppl. Compl.”); see also N.Z. Gov’t Answer to Compl. ¶ 39, July 15, 2020, ECF No. 14 (“N.Z. Answer”). It is the northernmost-located subspecies of the more popu- lous Hector’s dolphin, from which the Maui dolphin is morphologi- cally indistinguishable and differentiable only by DNA sequence. See First Suppl. Compl. ¶ 52. Out of the more than thirty species of dolphin in the world’s oceans, Maui and Hector’s dolphins are the smallest in the world.2 The parties all stress that the Maui dolphin’s situation is precari- ous. Beyond that, they have largely disagreed in this litigation as to the more granular details of the dolphin’s current abundance, its range, and the extent of the threat posed to it by fishing. See Sea Shepherd II, 606 F. Supp. 3d at 1297–98 (describing the differences in views). It is clear, however, that commercial fishing, particularly set net and trawl fishing,3 poses at least a major threat to the Maui dolphin’s continued survival. In 1999, the New Zealand Minister of Conserva- tion designated the Maui dolphin as a “threatened species,” and the Maui dolphin is defined as a “protected species” under New Zealand law. See First Suppl. Compl. ¶ 71. Since 2003, New Zealand has enacted some restrictions on gillnet and trawl fishing in the Maui dolphin’s range. See First Suppl. Compl. ¶ 60; N.Z. Answer ¶ 47. In 2007, New Zealand introduced a Threat Management Plan (“TMP”) to manage human-induced threats to Hector’s, and by extension, Maui dolphins. See Hector’s and Maui’s Dolphin Threat Mgmt. Plan Draft for Pub. Consult. at 8 (N.Z. Gov’t Aug. 29, 2007), AR4614; First Suppl. Compl. ¶ 73; N.Z. Answer ¶ 60. 2 See Facts About Hector’s & Maui Dolphin, N.Z. Dep’t of Conservation, www.doc.govt.nz/ nature/native-animals/marine-mammals/dolphins/maui-dolphin/facts/ (last visited Sept. 10, 2024). 3 Set nets, also known as gillnets, “are a type of non-selective fishing net that is hung vertically in the water for hours or . . . days . . . to harvest marine fish and other species.” First Suppl. Compl. ¶ 56. “Trawl fishing is another type of indiscriminate fishing method whereby . . . boats drag a large net through the water column, catching almost everything in the net’s path.” Id."
75,"77 CUSTOMS BULLETIN AND DECISIONS, VOL. 58, NO. 38, SEPTEMBER 25, 2024 Despite those efforts, a group of experts submitted a report to the International Whaling Commission (“IWC”)4 Scientific Committee in 2017 that calculated the Maui dolphin’s potential biological removal level (“PBR”).5 See First Suppl. Compl. ¶ 57. That study indicated that in order for the Maui dolphin’s stock to reach or maintain its optimum sustainable level, the subspecies can sustain the human- induced loss of only one individual roughly every 20 years. Id. Ac- cording to another 2019 study considered by the IWC, the estimated mean annual bycatch mortality for Maui dolphins in recent years was 1.8 to 2.4 individuals per year. See id. ¶ 58. That bycatch mortality rate vastly exceeded the PBR estimated by the 2017 report. Plaintiffs also argued that New Zealand’s TMP since 2007 fell far short of a recommendation by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (“IUCN”) to ban gill net and trawl net use from the shoreline to the 100-meter depth contour off the North Island within the Maui dolphin’s range, which Plaintiffs maintained included the waters off both the west and east coasts of the island. See id. ¶ 58. New Zealand initiated a process to revise its TMP for Hector’s and Maui dolphins in 2018. See First Suppl. Compl. ¶ 80; N.Z. Answer ¶¶ 44, 67. Throughout this litigation New Zealand has disputed, among other facts, the IWC study’s estimation of the PBR, the ongoing mortality rate, the attribution of deaths exclusively to fishing, and the purported range of the Maui dolphin. See Sea Shepherd II, 606 F. Supp. 3d at 1297–98. II. Legal Background and Procedural History Creating with certain exceptions a “moratorium on the taking and importation of marine mammals and marine mammal products,” the MMPA aims to protect marine mammals by setting U.S. standards applicable both to domestic commercial fisheries and to foreign fish- eries that wish to export their products to the United States.6 16 4 “The IWC was established in 1946 as the global body responsible for the management of whaling and conservation of whales. It is an inter-governmental organisation with a current membership of 88 governments,” including the United States and New Zealand. See Commission Overview, Int’l Whaling Comm’n, iwc.int/commission (last visited September 10, 2024). 5 PBR refers to the “maximum number of animals, not including natural mortalities, that may be removed from a marine mammal stock while allowing that stock to reach or maintain its optimum sustainable population.” 16 U.S.C. §§ 1362(20), 1386(a)(6). 6 This court has resolved similar litigation involving the MMPA’s applicability to the critically endangered vaquita, the world’s smallest porpoise, of which only 13 individuals are estimated to remain. See Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc. v. Ross, 42 CIT __, 331 F. Supp. 3d 1338 (2018); Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc. v. Ross, 42 CIT __, 331 F. Supp. 3d 1381 (2018); Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc. v.

76,"78 CUSTOMS BULLETIN AND DECISIONS, VOL. 58, NO. 38, SEPTEMBER 25, 2024 U.S.C. § 1371(a). The MMPA requires the Secretary of the Treasury to ban the “importation of commercial fish or products from fish which have been caught with commercial fishing technology which results in the incidental kill or incidental serious injury of ocean mammals in excess of United States standards.” See id. § 1371(a)(2). To determine whether such fish or fish products result in harm in excess of United States standards, the NOAA Imports Regulation requires foreign harvesting nations to secure “comparability findings” for their fish- eries importing fish and fish products into the United States. See 50 C.F.R. §§ 216.24(h)(1)(i), 216.3. Any subject fish or fish product har- vested in a fishery for which a valid comparability finding is not in effect is unlawful to import. See id. § 216.24(h)(1)(ii)(A). On February 6, 2019, Plaintiffs submitted a formal petition to the U.S. Departments of Homeland Security, Treasury, and Commerce requesting that those agencies invoke their rulemaking authority arising out of the MMPA to ban the importation of fish and fish products originating from New Zealand fisheries in the Maui dol- phin’s range that employ either gill nets or trawls. See Pls.’ Initial Maui Dolphin Pet. at 3, 12 (Feb. 6, 2019), AR0001 (“Initial Petition”). Plaintiffs urged immediate action because, “[c]ontrary to the MMPA, the United States, through the actions and omissions of the Agencies, currently allows the importation of fish and fish products from New Zealand fisheries that kill and injure critically endangered Maui dolphins in excess of United States standards.” Id. at 3–4. On July 10, 2019, NOAA rejected Plaintiffs’ Initial Petition, determining that New Zealand’s TMP was comparable to U.S. standards. See Notifica- tion of the Rejection, 84 Fed. Reg. 32853 (Dep’t Com. July 10, 2019), AR5426. On May 21, 2020, Plaintiffs filed their initial Complaint, which asserted two claims challenging NOAA’s denial: (1) that NOAA un- lawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed agency action in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. § 706(1), by failing to ban the import of commercial fish and products from fish caught using gillnet and trawls in the Maui dolphin’s range in excess of U.S. standards; and (2) that NOAA’s denial of Plaintiffs’ petition for emergency rulemaking was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discre- tion, and otherwise not in accordance with law under the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). See Original Compl. ¶¶ 84–88, 89–94. Separately, on June 24, 2020, New Zealand announced new domestic fishing measures intended to reduce Maui dolphin bycatch, which were the result of its review of TMP programs beginning in 2018. See N.Z. TMP Letter at 1."
77,"79 CUSTOMS BULLETIN AND DECISIONS, VOL. 58, NO. 38, SEPTEMBER 25, 2024 On July 1, 2020, Plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction embargoing the importation of certain fish products from New Zea- land into the United States. See Pls.’ Mot. for a Prelim. Inj., July 1, 2020, ECF No. 11. As part of their motion, Plaintiffs argued that New Zealand’s new measures still fell short of comparable U.S. standards. See id. at 16. On July 15, 2020, New Zealand instead requested that NOAA perform a comparability assessment for two fisheries—the West Coast North Island inshore trawl and inshore set net fisheries— pursuant to NOAA’s Imports Regulation. See Letter from N.Z. to U.S. Dep’t of Com., re: Comparability Finding Request (July 15, 2020), ECF No. 17–2. The United States accordingly moved for a voluntary remand for NOAA to reconsider the denial of Plaintiffs’ petition and to consider New Zealand’s request for comparability findings. See U.S. Gov’t Partial Consent Mot. to Remand Case, July 17, 2020, ECF No. 17. The court granted the motion and remanded the petition for reconsideration with an opportunity for Plaintiffs to supplement their original petition. See Sea Shepherd I, 469 F. Supp. 3d at 1337–38. On August 27, 2020, Plaintiffs submitted a supplemental petition to NOAA. See Pls.’ Aug. 27, 2020 Suppl. Maui Dolphin Pet. at 5 (Aug. 27, 2020), SUPP0005 (“Supplemental Petition”). The Supplemental Pe- tition broadened the requested ban, now including “the import of all fish and fish products originating from fisheries in the entirety of the Maui dolphin’s current and historical range, which includes the entire coastline of the North Island out to the 100m depth contour, that employ either set nets or trawls.” Plaintiffs argued that these mea- sures were necessary to meet U.S. standards and that, if not imple- mented, an embargo of all such fish and fish products was required by the MMPA. Id. at 3, 12–13, 15. On November 9, 2020, NOAA published its denial of Plaintiffs’ Supplemental Petition and issued comparability findings for New Zealand’s two relevant fisheries. See Notification of Rejection of Peti- tion and Issuance of Comparability Findings, 85 Fed. Reg. 71297, 71297 (Dep’t Com. Nov. 9, 2020), SUPP0001 (“First Comparability Findings”). It reasoned that New Zealand’s “regulatory program, implemented on October 1, 2020, will in all likelihood reduce Maui dolphin bycatch below PBR”—which NOAA calculated to allow one death every eight years—and was otherwise comparable in effective- ness to U.S. standards. See First Comparability Findings, 85 Fed. Reg. at 71298. NOAA also rejected Plaintiffs’ broad definition of the Maui dolphin’s habitat and limited it to the “west coast of the North Island.” See Dec. Mem. attach. A at 6. The issued comparability findings would remain in effect through January 1, 2023. See First Comparability Findings, 85 Fed. Reg. at 71297."
78,"80 CUSTOMS BULLETIN AND DECISIONS, VOL. 58, NO. 38, SEPTEMBER 25, 2024 On November 24, 2020, Plaintiffs filed the Supplemental Com- plaint, which restated the initial two claims and added a third claim that NOAA’s First Comparability Findings were arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and otherwise not in accordance with law under the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). See Suppl. Compl. ¶¶ 117–121.7 Plaintiffs later filed a Renewed Motion for Preliminary Injunction on December 11, 2020, again requesting an embargo. See Pls.’ Ren. PI Mot. The United States and New Zealand also moved to dismiss Plaintiffs’ first claim. See U.S. Mot. to Dismiss, Jan. 27, 2021, ECF No. 58; N.Z. Mot. to Dismiss, Jan. 15, 2021, ECF No. 56. Separately, anticipating the expiration of the First Comparability Findings, New Zealand submitted an application to NOAA on November 30, 2021, requesting new comparability findings for all of its fisheries— including the two fisheries at issue in this case—for the period fol- lowing January 1, 2023. See Joint Status Report, Jan. 7, 2022, ECF No. 90. On November 28, 2022, the court granted Plaintiffs’ motion and issued a preliminary injunction banning the importation of fish and fish products deriving from nine fish species caught in New Zealand’s West Coast North Island inshore trawl and set net fisheries, unless affirmatively identified as having been caught with a gear type other than gillnets or trawls. See Sea Shepherd II, 606 F. Supp. 3d at 1331; see also Order, Nov. 28, 2022, ECF No. 109. The court concluded that Plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their second and third claims, that irreparable harm to the Maui dolphin was likely absent an injunction, and that the balance of hardships weighed in Plaintiffs’ favor. Id. As for the first claim, the court granted the United States’s and New Zealand’s motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim arising under 5 U.S.C. § 706(1). See id. at 1309–10. NOAA’s denial of the Initial Petition was not a failure to act under 5 U.S.C. § 706(1), as Plaintiffs argued, but rather an affirmative agency action of denial that was more properly challenged by Plaintiffs’ second claim under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2). See id. Shortly thereafter on December 6, 2022, New Zealand moved to modify the preliminary injunction to allow for a grace period to implement a traceability system.8 See Sea Shepherd III, 611 F. Supp. 3d at 1408. The court denied the motion on January 9, 2023, reason- 7 The court notes an apparent typographical error in the paragraph numbering in Plaintiffs’ First Supplemental Complaint. Compare First Suppl. Compl. at 34–36, with id. at 37–38 (repeating paragraph numbers). The citations to paragraphs herein reflect numbering retabulated by the court. 8 The phrase “traceability system” referred to procedures that would have certified that exports of New Zealand fish and fish products to the United States were not of the kind prohibited by the preliminary injunction. See Sea Shepherd III, 611 F. Supp. 3d at 1408 n.4."
79,"81 CUSTOMS BULLETIN AND DECISIONS, VOL. 58, NO. 38, SEPTEMBER 25, 2024 ing that New Zealand had not established a change of circumstances that would make the continuation of the original injunction inequi- table. Id. at 1410. Then, in light of the expiration of the First Com- parability Findings on January 1, 2023, the United States moved to dismiss as moot Plaintiffs’ third claim. See U.S. Mot. to Dismiss, Feb. 2, 2023, ECF No. 132. On June 21, 2023, the court denied that motion, concluding that aspects of Plaintiffs’ request for declaratory relief under the third claim remained live. See Sea Shepherd IV, 639 F. Supp. 3d at 1371. Following that decision, the parties jointly moved to stay litigation in the case. See Joint Mot. for Stay of Litig., July 7, 2023, ECF No. 137. In that motion, the parties stated their view that “NMFS’ deci- sion on the pending comparability applications may obviate, in whole or in part, the need for continued litigation in this action.” Id. at 2. The court then stayed this litigation NOAA issued its decision on New Zealand’s pending comparability finding applications for New Zea- land’s North Island West Coast Fisheries. Order ¶ 1, July 14, 2023, ECF No. 138. At the time, NMFS was expected to issue the pending comparability findings relevant to this case by November 30, 2023. The NMFS later extended the MMPA exemption period by two years to end on December 31, 2025, meaning that NMFS had until Novem- ber 30, 2025, to issue the pending comparability findings relevant to this case. See Modification of Deadlines Under the Fish and Fish Product Import Provisions of the Marine Mammal Protection Act, 88 Fed. Reg. 80193, 80194 (Dep’t Com. Nov. 17, 2023); 50 C.F.R. § 216.24(h)(6)(ii). On January 24, 2024, NOAA published a new set of comparability findings covering the two fisheries at issue in this case. See Imple- mentation of Fish and Fish Product Import Provisions of the Marine Mammal Protection Act—Notification of Issuance of Comparability Findings, 89 Fed. Reg. 4595 (Dep’t Com. Jan. 24, 2024) (“Second Comparability Findings”). NOAA stated that it had reconsidered the First Comparability Findings, “based on supplemental information provided by Plaintiffs and New Zealand since that time,” and again concluded that New Zealand’s revised TMP of October 2020 was comparable in effectiveness to U.S. standards. Id. at 4596–97. NOAA noted that since the 2020–2021 fishing year, “fishing effort has been reduced by 71 percent for the trawl fleet and 97 percent for the set net fleet,” and “50 percent of trawl effort and 90 percent of set net effort were monitored.” Id. at 4596. Ultimately, NOAA concluded, New Zealand’s TMP “will result in Maui dolphin bycatch below PBR and concentrate the fisheries restrictions in the areas with the greatest risk, specifically those areas where fishing activities overlap with the"
80,"82 CUSTOMS BULLETIN AND DECISIONS, VOL. 58, NO. 38, SEPTEMBER 25, 2024 Maui dolphin population.” Id. at 4597. The Second Comparability Findings are valid until December 31, 2025. On March 19, 2024, New Zealand moved to dissolve the preliminary injunction. See N.Z. Unopposed Mot. to Dissolve the Prelim. Inj., Mar. 19, 2024, ECF No. 152. Plaintiffs did not oppose, and the United States consented to, the dissolution of the preliminary injunction. See id. at 2. The court concluded that NOAA’s issuance of the Second Comparability Findings constituted a “significant change in [the] factual conditions and law” underlying the preliminary injunction and dissolved the injunction. Sea Shepherd V, 693 F. Supp. 3d at 1367. Plaintiffs have since moved for extensions of the stay, with the consent of the United States and New Zealand, in order to negotiate the case’s stipulated dismissal and resolve any claims for attorneys’ fees and costs. See Pls.’ Status Report & Consent Mot. to Extend the Stay ¶ 1, July 22, 2024, ECF No. 160. Regarding the status of their second and third claims in the Supplemental Complaint, Plaintiffs have stated: In light of NOAA’s issuance of the new comparability findings for New Zealand’s West Coast North Island multi-species set-net and trawl fisheries . . . , Plaintiffs’ third claim for relief (chal- lenging NOAA’s October 26, 2020 comparability finding) is likely moot. Plaintiffs are not going to challenge the new comparability findings or further pursue their second claim for relief (challeng- ing NOAA’s denials of Plaintiffs’ Petitions). As such, once Plain- tiffs and Defendants resolve Plaintiffs’ request for attorneys’ fees and costs, the Parties intend to submit a proposed stipulated dismissal of the case. Id. ¶ 5. The court granted the motions extending the stay to allow for the case’s resolution. See Order, July 24, 2024, ECF No. 161; Order, June 21, 2024, ECF No. 159; Order, May 20, 2024, ECF No. 155; Order, Mar. 13, 2024, ECF No. 151. DISCUSSION On August 23, 2024, the parties filed a joint stipulation of dismissal with prejudice under USCIT Rule 41. See Notice of Dismissal. On September 9, 2024, the parties filed a copy of their settlement agree- ment. See Settlement Agreement, Sept. 9, 2024, ECF No. 165. Under the terms of the stipulated dismissal and the settlement agreement, this action will be dismissed with prejudice and the United States will pay to Plaintiffs $375,000.00 in attorneys’ fees and costs, pursuant to"
81,"83 CUSTOMS BULLETIN AND DECISIONS, VOL. 58, NO. 38, SEPTEMBER 25, 2024 the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d). See id; Notice of Dismissal. Under USCIT Rule 41, a plaintiff “may dismiss an action without a court order by filing . . . a stipulation of dismissal signed by all parties who have appeared.” USCIT R. 41(a)(1)(A)(ii). The court held a con- ference on September 10, 2024. During that conference, the parties provided an overview of the preceding litigation and confirmed their intention to dismiss this action with prejudice. See Status Confer- ence.9 The court retains jurisdiction to enforce the United States’s payment obligations under the parties’ agreement on attorneys’ fees and costs associated with this case. To be clear, this opinion does not preclude future legal challenges to the Second Comparability Find- ings. Nor does the court suggest any view on the Second Compara- bility Findings. The case’s dismissal is issued below, and this case is now closed. But the fate of the Maui dolphin is not so easily resolved. Recent estimates indicate that approximately forty-three dolphins remain, and their population has declined at the rate of 3 to 4 percent per year between 2001 and 2021.10 Today’s disposition, then, is far from bill of health for a species teetering on the brink of extinction. As the court noted in prior litigation involving the similarly critically endangered vaquita, see supra note 6, the loss of a species represents a “loss of biodiversity, unique evolutionary history, and the potential for future evolution.” NRDC IV, 456 F. Supp. 3d at 1294. It can be noted that the outcome here reflects the efforts of Plain- tiffs, the United States, and New Zealand as they all work within complex domestic and transnational legal frameworks to avert catas- trophe. At stake is nothing less than the survival of the Maui dolphin, which cannot be replaced. CONCLUSION A voluntary dismissal by joint stipulation under Rule 41(a)(1)(A)(ii) is effective “automatically.” Versata Software, Inc. v. Callidus Soft- ware, Inc., 780 F.3d 1134, 1136 (Fed. Cir. 2015). The Order of Volun- tary Dismissal is granted as requested, and is issued below.
